# Recently Used Documents web part

This web part provides you the ability to display a list of a particular user's recently used documents on a web page. The web part may be configured to display a pre-defined number of documents at a time. This web part is powered by the Microsoft Graph and uses the me/insights/used Graph endpoint, while filtering out document types including: "Web", "spsite", "Folder", "Archive", "Image", and "Other".
