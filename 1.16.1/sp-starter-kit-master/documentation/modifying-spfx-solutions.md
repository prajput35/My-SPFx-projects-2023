# Notes and suggestions when modifying included SPFx solutions

This project includes multiple SPFx solutions including webparts, extensions, and libraries that come pre-included and deployed to the tenant app catalog with a [default installation of the SP Starter Kit](../provisioning).

You may also consider [Manually deploying the SP Starter Kit .sppkg SPFx solution packages to the tenant App Catalog](./manual-deploy-sppkg-solution.md)

## Notes and recommendations

1. SPFx source files are found in the [source](../source) folder
2. Ensure you are using Node.js version 16.x, e.g. [Node.js 16.15.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/), as the SPFx solutions are currently configured to use SPFx version 1.16.1.
