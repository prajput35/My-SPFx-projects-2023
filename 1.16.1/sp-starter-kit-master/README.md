# SharePoint Starter Kit v3

The SharePoint Starter Kit (starter kit) is a comprehensive solution designed for SharePoint Online which provides numerous SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web parts, extensions, and other components, as well as [PnP PowerShell](https://github.com/pnp/powershell) driven provisioning which you can use as an example and inspiration for your own customizations. 

![PnP Starter Pack Front Page](./assets/images/default-front-page-v2.png)

> Starter Kit V3 **does not** support SharePoint 2019 and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition.

> Starter Kit Version 1 includes a comprenshive strategy for only SharePoint Online, as well as a single SPFx solution that encapsulates all webparts and extensions into a single package. Version 1 may be accessed via the [v1 branch](https://github.com/pnp/sp-starter-kit/tree/v1) for legacy purposes and will not be maintained beyond April 2020.

> Notice: There currently **is not** a direct path for upgrading an existing SharePoint Online tenant with the starter kit v1 to v3. V3 may be installed into a tenant with v1 already installed, by default, this will add a tenant wide duplicate all of webparts and extensions. It is recommended that the starter kit v1 be removed from a tenant before adding v3, or creating a custom installation of v3.

> Starter Kit Version 2 includes a strategy for SharePoint Online and SharePoint 2019 and includes individual SPFx solutions for each webpart and application customizer. Version 2 may be accessed via the [v2 branch](https://github.com/pnp/sp-starter-kit/tree/v2) for legacy purposes and will not be maintained beyond February 2023. Starter Kit Version 2 is the only version that supports SharePoint 2019.

> Notice: The direct path for upgrading an existing SharePoint Online tenant with the starter kit v2 to v3 is to only install / invoke the [starterkit-spfx-only.pnp](./provisioning/starterkit-spfx-only.pnp) provisioning template found in the [./provisioning](./provisioning) folder. This provisioning template will only upgrade the existing SPFx solutions to V3 (SPFx version 1.16.1), and will not recreate the sample sites.

> Notice: the starter kit adds **tenant level settings** including themes, site designs, taxonomy term sets, and other adjustments. Therefore, it is recommended to test the starter kit in an **isolated test tenant and not immediately execute it within your production environment**.

## Objectives of this solution

SharePoint Communication Sites and Team Sites have great out-of-the-box capabilities, although the out-of-the-box capabilities may not always be sufficient for your scenarios. This is exactly why SharePoint may be extended and you are able to include your own customizations. This solution addresses common scenarios and tasks you may encounter when introducing those customizations, and provides examples and guidance on how you might address and provision them including:

- Automated provisioning of simple demo content within a communication site
- Automated provisioning of multiple team sites with pre-configuration and hub site association
- Automated provisioning of the whole solution to any tenant within minutes
- Automated configuration of Site Scripts and Site Designs at the tenant level using the PnP Remote Provisioning engine (SharePoint Online only)
- Implementation of different customizations for SharePoint
- Usage of Fluent UI and reusable PnP SPFx controls within the customizations

## SharePoint Starter Kit v3 has following objectives

* Extend the success of v1 and v2 by providing developers a customization and provisioning strategy for SharePoint Online
* Demonstrate new SharePoint Online UX design and layout capabilities including:
   * Full height vertical columns
   * Compact headers 
   * Mega menus
   * Background theming
* Support web parts, extensions, and libraries to be deployed one-by-one to tenants or farms
* Demonstrate teams tab development with SharePoint Framework for suitable web parts in SharePoint Online
* Demonstrate Microsoft Graph API and Graph Toolkit (current version mgt-react 2.9.0) usage in SharePoint Online


## Pre-requirements

Here are current pre-requirements for making this solution work in your tenant.

1. You will need to be a tenant administrator to be able to deploy this solution
    - Notice that you can get free developer tenant from [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program), if needed.

1. Automatic end-to-end provisioning only works with English tenants
    - All solutions and web parts are also English in the current implementation
    - For tenants that have English but have a different default language, the [term set provisioning may be modified to assist with installation](./documentation/term-store.md#non-english-tenants)

1. Add the tenant administrator account used during provisioning as Term Store Administrator in the Taxonomy Term Store through the SharePoint Admin Center.

1. A tenant 'App Catalog' must have been created within the 'Apps' option of the SharePoint Admin Center.

> **It is recommended that you wait up to 24 hours before attempting to provision this solution if any of the following are true**
> - Your SharePoint tenant was just created
> - You just created your SharePoint tenant app catalog

> **This project will install [Microsoft Graph Toolkit for SPFx version 2.9.0](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-toolkit/releases) into the app catalog. If you have another version already installed, you will want to remove that package before installing the Starter Kit**

## Getting started

Shortest path to success for SharePoint Online - The following steps will help you get started in any SharePoint Online tenant as fast as possible.

> Starter Kit v3 no longer supports SharePoint 2019,  [refer to the SharePoint 2019 installation instructions for v2](https://github.com/pnp/sp-starter-kit/blob/v2/provisioning/readme-sp2019.md)

- Ensure you meet the [Pre-requirements](#Pre-requirements)

- Ensure that you meet the [requirements for SharePoint Framework development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment) and are using the latest version of [PnP PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/installation.html). **Latest confirmed version of PnP PowerShell: 1.12.0**.

- Prepare your tenant, by accomplishing the tasks highlighted in document [Preparing your tenant for the PnP SharePoint Starter Kit](./documentation/tenant-settings.md)

- Open PowerShell, and use PnP PowerShell to connect to any site in your tenant with the [`Connect-PnPOnline` cmdlet](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/cmdlets/Connect-PnPOnline.html) using your own tenant url. For more information on authenticating with PnP PowerShell, see [documentation](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/authentication.html) 

  ```powershell
  Connect-PnPOnline https://contosodemosk.sharepoint.com
  ```

- Change to the `provisioning` folder found in this solution's root and execute the following command (using your own tenant url and the prefix of your choosing):

  ```powershell
  Invoke-PnPTenantTemplate -Path .\starterkit.pnp
  ```

  This will provision three site collections with urls of `/sites/demoportal`, `/sites/demohr`, and `/sites/demomarketing`. Your urls may vary depending on the managed path you selected for team sites in your tenant administration (this defaults to 'sites').

    - Refer to the ['provisioning documentation'](./provisioning) for advanced provisioning options and guidance

    - If you run into errors during provisioning, refer to ['Common SP Starter Kit Provisioning results'](./documentation/common-provision-results.md) for additional suggestions and common mistakes

- This solution will automatically install multiple SPFx webparts that require API permissisons to the Graph API. **After installing this solution**, access your API Management page in your SharePoint Admin Center and approve the pending requests.

> Notice that the starter kit also adds tenant level settings including themes, site designs, taxonomy term sets, and other adjustments. Therefore, it is recommended you test the starter kit in an **isolated test tenant and not immediately execute it within your production environment**.
