## SharePoint Framework solution package - SP Starter Kit V1

It is recommended to package the solution as needed using the latest version of available code, but you can also upload the sppkg file available in this folder directly to your app catalog to speed up the setup process.

This .sppkg is a legacy package from SP Starter Kit V1.
